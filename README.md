# Montecarlo-System
This is a Montecarlo system developed for a 4th year subject of University with the followings requirements:
A person arrives at the bus stop in the center of town and needs to travel to the boulevard stop. Past experiences indicate that 20% of the time, the interval between buses at the arrival stop is 20 minutes; 40% of the time the interval is 40 minutes, and 40% of the time the interval is 2 hours. Additionally, one out of every ten buses has a defect on the route between the two stops, preventing it from leaving the town.

30% of the time, there is a traffic delay that causes the bus to be delayed by an additional 5 minutes between stops.

What is the average waiting time for a person who has just arrived at the boulevard stop?
